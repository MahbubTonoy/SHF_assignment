        <strong>HTML</strong> is the standard markup language for creating Web
        pages. <em>html</em> stands for
        <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language.</strong> <em>html</em> is the
        standard markup language for creating Web pages. <em>html</em> describes
        the structure of a Web page. <em>html</em> consists of a series of
        elements. <em>html</em> elements tell the browser how to display the
        content. <em>html</em> elements label pieces of content such as "this is
        a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. The HyperText
        Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents
        designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
        web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
        semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
        document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
        constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
        embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such
        as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the
        page. Other tags such as
      </p>

      <p>
        surround and provide information about document text and may include
        other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but
        use them to interpret the content of the page.
      </p>
      <h3>What is an HTML element</h3>
      An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end
      tag.<br />
      HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are
      indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus:
      <p>
        . In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by
        a pair of tags: a "start tag" &lt;p&gt; and "end tag" &lt;/p&gt;. The
        text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags. Tags
        may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including
        a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as
        children of the parent element.
        <br />
        Example:
        <code>
          <pre>
  &lt;p&gt;
    Hello World
  &lt;/p&gt;

        </pre>
        </code>
      </p>

      <h3>The Web Browser</h3>
      Web Browser is a kind of native application/browser that used to browse
      the internet and open web pages and content. there is multiple web browser
      used by the people in the modern world.
      <ol>
        <li>Chrome</li>
        <li>Firefox</li>
        <li>Safari</li>
        <li>Opera</li>
        <li>MS Edge</li>
      </ol>
      Most of the modern browser supports <em>HTML</em> latest version, and that
      is <em>HTML5</em>.

    In 1980, physicist
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/" target="_BLANK" title="about Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
    researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
    proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and
    wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee
    and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint
    request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In
    his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which
    hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first. <br /><br/>

    there is some versions of HTML:
